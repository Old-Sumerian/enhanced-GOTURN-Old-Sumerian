# Enhanced GOTURN

**This project offers an enhanced and concise version of GOTURN: Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks.**

**Originally based on the GOTURN project (http://davheld.github.io/GOTURN/GOTURN.html), this implementation simplifies the setup and testing process by eliminating some redundant files. The intent is to make it easier to test the algorithm with your own videos.**

The original work, GOTURN, was presented in the following paper:
